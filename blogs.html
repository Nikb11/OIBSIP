                Hey this is my first blog and I would like to address my so far education and 
                corporate experience!!<br>
                As I had Completed my Bsc in Computer science I was looking for job 
                opportunity as our college came up<br> with very few placements .
                Then I started preparing for the hirings and got offer letter from one of the
                organisation which I had applied !!<br>
                Was not aware how it would be starting by career in A Corporate Life.
                I always wanted to learn Web <br>and things related to it as I was much interested 
                in developing the UI but I got alloted to a Backend project which didnt had UI screen and 
                was totally backend based on SQL and JAVA .
